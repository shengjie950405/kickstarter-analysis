Based on the chart. we can observe the possiblity of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for plays by the targeting goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Need to follow with course Module step by step to understand some of the questions from assignment.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Please launch play in May
2. Don't launch play in December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If Louise really want a play over $10000 budget, then please remain at the range between $10000 - $20000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It's better to have data about the themes of the play. It's also a significant factor of a succeful campaign
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Outcomes_vs_Launch could have a table and graph that could represent and visulize the successful and failed rate.
